# Space-Engineers-Library

This is a library containing a few script components for use in Space Engineers.

The script components within the Space Engineers Toolbox mixin / library can be copied directly into a Space Engineers script and used as-is (just the class), but I would recommend making use of the full Visual Studio Solution because it uses MDK, which helps you develop and test your scripts from within the IDE.

To use the full solution, you would need to use Visual Studio 2019, with the MDK extension installed.

At the time of writing, MDK is not yet available for Visual Studio 2022.

To install MDK, follow the instructions here: [Getting Started with MDK](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki/Getting-Started-with-MDK)

Kudos to [malware-dev](https://github.com/malware-dev) for the awesome MDK.
